# Automobile Recession Data Visualization

## Objective
To analyze the impact of economic recession periods on automobile sales using data visualization techniques.  
The project focuses on identifying trends, patterns, and segment-wise performance during recession and non-recession years.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical automobile sales data across multiple years, including:
- Year
- Sales volume
- Vehicle type/category
- Economic indicators (recession flag)
- Other related attributes

The data includes both recession and stable economic periods to enable comparative analysis.

## Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
- Grouping and aggregation of time-series data
- Comparative analysis between recession and non-recession periods
- Line plots for trend analysis
- Bar charts for category-wise comparison
- Subplots for multi-variable visualization

## Key Insights
- Automobile sales show noticeable decline during recession periods.
- Certain vehicle categories are more sensitive to economic downturns.
- Recovery patterns vary across different segments of the automobile market.
- Long-term trends indicate cyclical behavior linked to economic conditions.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
